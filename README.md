### Statement details:
### Question 1--> What are the factors of price variability?

To answer our first question, we need to deep dive on the price variability for different factors such as property type, policy and other accommodations. Here we will factorize the rental price across property type.

### Question 2--> Is there any correlation between the availability of rents and the price?

Next we move forward to answer the second question. To find out the relation between availability of rentals and price, we needed to crunch the data with timestamps. We analyzed the data from August 2016 to August 2017 and tried to dig out that relationship. Some interesting incidents were observed when the availability and prices are shown together. 


### Question 3--> Can the company impact the monthly variation of rents after analyzing the year long trend?

Lastly the monthly variation of rentals are studied to obtain the trend over a year. This is specially crucial for company revenue to be focused on certain months rather than highly depending on peak seasons.
